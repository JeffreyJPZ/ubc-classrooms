# UBC Classrooms

UBC Classrooms is a tool for finding empty classrooms across UBC at specific times. The frontend was written using React, while Django and PostgreSQL were used for the backend.

Frontend project structure was inspired by [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react?tab=readme-ov-file#bulletproof-react-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F).

## Instructions for running the application locally
1. Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
   - [Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-v4-x/model.html#~tab-downloads)
   
   Linux:
   - [Docker Engine and CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
   
   Windows:
   - [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   
   macOS:
   - [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

2. Clone the repo to your desired directory using the command line (Git Bash for Windows/macOS)
   
    ```bash
    $ # Create a new directory to clone the repo to (replace "projects/ubc-classrooms" with whatever path you wish, or skip this step if your desired directory exists already)
    $ mkdir -p projects/ubc-classrooms
    $ # Set the working directory (replace "projects/ubc-classrooms" with the path to your desired directory)
    $ cd projects/ubc-classrooms
    $ # Clone the repo
    $ git clone https://github.com/JeffreyJPZ/ubc-classrooms.git
    ```
    
3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following format:

   ```
   POSTGRES_NAME=ubc_classrooms
   POSTGRES_USER=default
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=default
   DB_HOST=db
   TEST_NAME=test
   ```
   
5. Create a config file for UBC VPN
   - Follow the instructions in `workflowscript.sh`
      
6. Run the workflow script
   - You may have to change some dependency paths â€” instructions are found in `workflowscript.sh`

   Bash:
   
      ```bash
      $ ./workflowscript.sh
      ```
   
   Windows Command Prompt or Powershell:
   
      ```cmd
      .\workflowscript.bat
      ```
  
7. Start the required services:
   
    ```bash
    $ # Start the web and database services
    $ docker compose up -d db web
    ```

8. Run the application
   
    ```bash
    $ # Navigate to the UBC Classrooms application
    $ cd frontend
    $ # Install the required dependencies
    $ npm install
    $ # Run the application in development mode
    $ npm run dev
    ```

9. Access the application at http://localhost:3000/

10. To stop the application and reclaim disk space, do the following:
   
    - Press CTRL + C to stop the application and regain control of the command line
    - Run the following commands:
    
      ```bash
      $ # Stops the services
      $ docker compose down
      $ # Removes services and other utilities, frees up disk space
      $ docker system prune
      ```
